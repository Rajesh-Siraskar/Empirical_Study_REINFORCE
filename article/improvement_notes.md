## IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------

- Title shorter - removed "milling"
- Abstract
- Code replaced by Algo
- Section Environment feedback
- Section Reward function
- Large table - bold for visibility of RF values
- Pg. 20: Evaluating the results. Sec. Overall summary performance
- All tables suplemented with visual color bar plots 
- All large tables (perf. across 10 rounds) and all detailed plots moved to appendix
- max values in dicated in BLUE
- Only F beta plots of all categories kept in main text
- Table of results with reference links (to actual tables and plots) 
** RESULTS sec begins with a "guide" to the the section

We present the summarized results in this section accompanied by commentary referring to detailed results made available in Appendix {\ref{apx}}. Since there are several tables and figures, for reference, we created a ****cross-linked**** Table {\ref{tbl:ref-results}}. Tables in this section and Appendix {\ref{apx}} use ****blue**** text to highlight prominent values. Summary performance and F-beta (0.5) plots accompany tables to assist in visualizing the comparative performance. The F-beta (0.5) plots are \textit{individual} performance over 10 rounds of training-validation and help infer training stability. Similar plots for precision, recall and F1 have been ****relegated**** to Appendix
